# Key Generation Script for Android Build

This script automates the process of generating the necessary keys for building Android or LineageOS. The keys are used to sign the Android build.

## Script Overview

The script performs the following steps:

1. **Prompts the user for the build type**: AOSP or LineageOS (LOS).
2. **Prompts the user for the necessary certificate details**.
3. **Generates keys for the specified build type**.
4. **Moves the keys to the appropriate directory**.
5. **Sets up the keys for use in the build process**.

## Usage

### Running the Script

1. **Make the script executable**:

   ```sh
   Move the script to source root directory
   chmod +x generate_all_keys.sh
   ./generate_all_keys.sh

   ```

2. **Add below line to any make file to Signing your Build (LOS Based Rom)**:

   ```sh
   $(call inherit-product, vendor/lineage-priv/keys/keys.mk)
   ```

3. **Add below line to any make file to Signing your Build (AOSP Based Rom)**:

   ```sh
   $(call inherit-product, vendor/extra/product.mk)
   ```
